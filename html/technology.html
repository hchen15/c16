    <h4>
      A major reason for the ubiquitous commercial success of palm oil and palm kernel oil is that <i>Elaeis guineensis </i>is a ruthlessly efficient crop: on a per-hectare basis, it is more than 5 times more efficient than oilseed crops (rapeseed, soy, sunflower).  It is extremely unlikely that a conventional agricultural approach will offer a truly sustainable alternative to conflict palm oil without relying on a considerable price premium. </h4>
      
      <h4 style="margin-top: 50px;"> <b>C16 proposes a different route: we aim to brew palm oil like beer, offering a truly sustainable palm oil alternative. </b></h4><h4>Fermentation is a well-proven commercial process that has been used for centuries: beer, cheese and yogurt all rely on the metabolism of microorganisms to convert raw materials into consumable commercial products that billions of people consume every day. </h4>
       
      <h4 style="margin-top: 50px">Why hasn’t this been done yet?  In short, because the cheap cost of palm oil (~$800/ton) is a difficult technical target. There are two major strategies for commercial fermentation.
      <ul> <li>The first is to use algae—either plant-like “green algae” or cyanobacteria “blue-green algae”.  Algae are extremely cheap to grow: they are photosynthetic and need little beyond light and water (approximately 1 cent per 10 liters of culture). However, they are not very efficient at producing oil: the best cyanobacteria can produce around 200 mg of oil / L of growth. </li>
      <li> In contrast, certain strains of oily yeasts (“oleaginous yeast”) can produce up to 100 g/L of oil. But yeast are expensive to grow: they are heterotrophic and need to be fed sugar to grow. The sugarcane dependence of yeast also fundamentally undermines the sustainability value proposition, since it simply shifts the dependence on oil palm plantations in Indonesia to sugarcane plantations in Brazil. </li>
      While each of these microorganisms have been shown to produce all of the key components of palm oil—including all fatty acid components and beta carotene--, neither approach has been shown to compete on price.
    </h4>
       
      <h4 style="margin-top: 50px"><span style="font-weight: 600;"> We have developed a new process for growing algae and yeast together in the same pot, wedding the low cost of algae culture with the productivity of yeast.</span> </h4><h4>Algae are among the most efficient organisms in nature for turning sunlight into sugar, and oleaginous yeast are among the most efficient at turning sugar into oil. Co-culturing microorganisms like this is not straightforward or obvious. Different species and even strains have evolved to grow under very different conditions. Simply throwing a cyanobacteria and a yeast in the same pot will generally lead to either both dying or one quickly overwhelming the other, dominating the culture.  By fine-tuning our culture, we have developed an approach in which the two species can grow symbiotically. By marrying the low-cost of algae culture with the high productivity of yeast, we are confident that we can match—or even beat—the price of conflict palm oil. </h4>
